When I first quit drinking, I got some Athletic beers and I enjoyed them but they had a lot of flaws. Over time, I\\u2019ve found that Run Wild and some of their IPAs and Fruited sours really hit the mark. I\\u2019ve felt that some of their one offs and darker styles have a lot of flaws and sound good but don\\u2019t nail it. I\\u2019ve bought a decent amount of 12 packs that I wish I would have only bought a single 6 pack of. \\n\\nWhen I saw this beer, I thought it sounded fantastic but I was skeptical that it would be a good beer. Theres just too many adjuncts and I\\u2019ve never been impressed with any of their darker styles. Overall, I\\u2019m glad they made it. I love having different options and variety, but it\\u2019s very muddled. \\n\\nIt reminds me of an amber style Homebrew I made once with Belgian candy sugar. The body is a touch too thin and the flavors are muddled with a lingering finish of marshmallow (not in a bad way). The sweetness is good. I\\u2019m glad it\\u2019s not overly sweet. None of the beers that they\\u2019ve made that I\\u2019ve tried are. The smoked malt adds a little bit of complexity, but the rest of the adjuncts just all come at once and none really stand out or play nicely with the others. They\\u2019re all just there at the same time. \\n\\nAll in all, I think it\\u2019s great that there\\u2019s a company out there taking chances and making fun styles, but this one may have done it for me. In the back of my mind I knew it wouldn\\u2019t blow me away, but I was hoping maybe I\\u2019d be wrong.

       "   'selftext': 'This arrived today. When I first quit drinking, I got some Athletic beers and I enjoyed them but they had a lot of flaws. Over time, I’ve found that Run Wild and some of their IPAs and Fruited sours really hit the mark. I’ve felt that some of their one offs and darker styles have a lot of flaws and sound good but don’t nail it. I’ve bought a decent amount of 12 packs that I wish I would have only bought a single 6 pack of. \\n\\nWhen I saw this beer, I thought it sounded fantastic but I was skeptical that it would be a good beer. Theres just too many adjuncts and I’ve never been impressed with any of their darker styles. Overall, I’m glad they made it. I love having different options and variety, but it’s very muddled. \\n\\nIt reminds me of an amber style Homebrew I made once with Belgian candy sugar. The body is a touch too thin and the flavors are muddled with a lingering finish of marshmallow (not in a bad way). The sweetness is good. I’m glad it’s not overly sweet. None of the beers that they’ve made that I’ve tried are. The smoked malt adds a little bit of complexity, but the rest of the adjuncts just all come at once and none really stand out or play nicely with the others. They’re all just there at the same time. \\n\\nAll in all, I think it’s great that there’s a company out there taking chances and making fun styles, but this one may have done it for me. In the back of my mind I knew it wouldn’t blow me away, but I was hoping maybe I’d be wrong. I might just stick with what I know with Athletic (IPAs and sours) and buy a single or two of these when the Bottleshop nearby carries anything different.',\n",
